# Random-silly-joke-generator
A simple project involving random jokes API by utilizing Express.js, Node,js, and using Axios as a promise-based HTTP Client for the browser while using EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for templating.

## Purpose of the project
I made this basic project as a requisite for my ongoing studies to become a full stack web developer.


## How to use it
You must first install `Node.js` and initialize it by typing `npm init -y`. Then you download all the packages and dependencies by typing `npm i`.
Lastly, on your local browswer go through `localhost:3000` as the default port for this project.
